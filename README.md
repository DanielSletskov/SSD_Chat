# Solution to sercure chat

## Scope coppied from project discription.
Your solution should allow two-people to communicate with each other without the risk of eavesdropping. Group chats, where more than two people send/receive messages at a time, is out scope.

Bonus if your application allows for near real-time communication. It can be achieved with WebSocket, socket.io, SignalR, TCP-socket, using a message queue or so on.

I donâ€™t expect the UI to look fancy. A simple unstyled HTML page, plain GUI or CLI/TUI is fine. The only requirement regarding UI is that it should be obvious how to use it.


## Setup for solution

1. After downloading the project go into your prefered IDE.   
2. In the IDE locate the terminal and go to the folder **SSDChat_SignalR**
3. And when the folder is located run the commman  **dotnet run**
4. This commnand will give a localhost url which is used to host the chat.

## App in use 
After the connection is setup use any browser to display the chat.  
Then connect to the same URL in a new tab.
