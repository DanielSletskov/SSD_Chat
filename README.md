# Solution to sercure chat

## Scope  
(coppied from project discription)  
Your solution should allow two-people to communicate with each other without the risk of eavesdropping. Group chats, where more than two people send/receive messages at a time, is out scope.

Bonus if your application allows for near real-time communication. It can be achieved with WebSocket, socket.io, SignalR, TCP-socket, using a message queue or so on.

I donâ€™t expect the UI to look fancy. A simple unstyled HTML page, plain GUI or CLI/TUI is fine. The only requirement regarding UI is that it should be obvious how to use it.

## User scenario
Two agents uses the chat for discussing confidential infiltration tactics in a secure web area.  

## Setup for solution

1. After downloading the project go into your prefered IDE.   
2. In the IDE locate the terminal and go to the folder **SSDChat_SignalR**
3. And when the folder is located run the commman  **dotnet run**
4. This commnand will give a localhost url which is used to host the chat.

## App in use 
After the connection is setup use any browser to display the chat.  
Then connect to the same URL in a new tab.  
These two windows can now safely chat with eachother.

## What security measures are used in this chat  
It was chosen to use a razor
  
1. AES Encryption - Using CryptoJS's AES implementation for encrypting messages
2. Cryptographically secure random key generation: The generateRandomKey() function uses window.crypto.getRandomValues() to generate cryptographically strong random values for keys.
3. Key Derivation Function (KDF): The code implements PBKDF2 through the deriveKey() function to strengthen encryption keys with:  
1000 iterations  
SHA-256 hashing algorithm  
256-bit key size  
A salt value ("ChatSalt123")  
4. Initialization Vector (IV): The encryption uses IVs stored in session storage for AES encryption.
5. Session storage for keys: Encryption keys and IVs are stored in the browser's sessionStorage, which persists only for the current session and is cleared when the browser closes.
6. Separate key management: The application fetches encryption configuration from the server via /api/Encryption/getEncryptionConfig API
7. SignalR for secure real-time communication: The code uses SignalR for real-time messaging which typically provides transport layer security.

## End notes

I know the setup is the same but when I try to execute dotnet run without for moving to the specified location I get an error.
